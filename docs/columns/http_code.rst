HTTP Code
=========

.. note::
  This section reflects exactly what the code does. So any changes made here should also be reported to the code or at least the configuration file.

.. note::
  A :code:`***` in this column means that it was impossible to catch the HTTP status code from the web server.

.. note::
  The Status Codes we give to PyFunceble to test with can be fully customized in your own :code:`.PyFunceble.yaml`.

We have categorized the HTTP Code into 3 parts.

- Active

  - Consider those ones like the one that influences HTTP source logic.
  - Please note that the domain is automatically introduced into the official outputs but we keep a record of it :code:`output/Analytic/ACTIVE`.

- Potentially Active

  - If the domain status returned by other methods are different from :code:`INACTIVE` or :code:`INVALID` and the HTTP status code is into that list, we save the domain into :code:`output/Analytic/POTENTIALLY_ACTIVE`

- Inactive or potentially inactive

  - If the domain status returned by other methods are different from :code:`ACTIVE` and the HTTP status code is on that list, we save the domain into :code:`output/Analytic/POTENTIALLY_INACTIVE`
