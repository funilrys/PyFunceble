SPECIAL rules
-------------

Why do we need it?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As PyFunceble grew up, I thought that a bit of filtering for special cases
would be great to introduce. That where the idea came from.

How does it work?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. note::
    For any new suggestion of domains where a special rule can enhance
    PyFunceble please either open a new issue or make your
    `contribution <../contributing/index.html#contribute>`_ directly into the
    project.

.. note::
    **Contribution to the SPECIAL rules**

    To add directly to the special rules please modify both the source code
    `extra_rules.py <https://github.com/funilrys/PyFunceble/blob/dev/PyFunceble/checker/availability/extra_rules.py>`_
    and the documentation (here).

Below is the list of all special rules that are implemented into PyFunceble.
Please keep in mind that you can disable the usage those rules at any time.
