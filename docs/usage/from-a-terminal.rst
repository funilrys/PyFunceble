    Switch the branch name where we are going to push the final results.

    **Default value:** :code:`master`

.. note::
    The difference between this and :code:`--ci-branch` is the fact
    that this branch will get the (final) result only when the test is finished
    under the given :code:`--ci-branch`.

    As an example, this allows us to have 2 branches:

    This argument is only used if :code:`--ci` or :code:`ci: true`  (under
    :code:`.PyFunceble.yaml`) are used.

.. note::
    This argument is only used if we have to split the work into multiple
    processes because a list is too long or the timeout is reached.

.. warning::
    Please avoid the usage of :code:`[ci skip]` here.

Unique actions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:code:`--clean`

    :code:`.gitignore`

:code:`--clean-all`
"""""""""""""""""""

    Clean all files under the output directory along with all file generated
    by PyFunceble.

.. warning::
    This deletes almost everything we generated without any warning.

.. note::
    We don't delete the whois database file/table because they are (almost)
    static data which are shared across launches in your environment.

.. warning::
    If you plan to clean manually do not delete the whois database file or
    table as it will make your test finish under a much longer time as usual
    for you.

.. warning::
    If you don't combine this argument alongside with the :code:`--database-type`
    argument or its configurable equivalent, this argument will only clean the
    JSON formatted databases.

:code:`--directory-structure`
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

    Generate the directory and files that are needed and which does not exist
    in the current directory.

Want to start without anything? This argument generates the output directory
