Autoconfiguration
-----------------

Sometimes, you may find yourself in a position that you do not or you canâ€™t
answer the question which asks you if you would like to merge an upstream
configuration file into your local one.

For that reason, if you can set the :code:`PYFUNCEBLE_AUTO_CONFIGURATION`
as an environment variable. Setting that environment variable will make
PyFunceble merge the upstream configuration when a new key is available but
not found into your configuration file.

.. warning::
    As of :code:`4.0.0` the configuration file is automatically copied into
    your configuration directory - if it is not found.
