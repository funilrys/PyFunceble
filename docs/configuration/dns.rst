.. warning::
    Please be careful when you overwrite this option. If one is not correct,

    **Type:** :code:`boolean`

    **Default value:** :code:`False`

    **Description:** Activates or disables the trust mode. When the trust mode
    is active and the first read DNS server gives us a negative response
    (without any error), we take it as it is.

    Otherwise, when the trust mode is disabled, when the first read DNS server
    gives us a negative response (without any error), we still ask all other
    DNS servers that were given or found.
