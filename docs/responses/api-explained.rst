API Responses (explained)
-------------------------

In this page, we intend to explain the most useful parts of the API responses.

:code:`checker_type`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The checker type. It describes the checker which was used to provide
the given response.

It should be one of the following:

- :code:`SYNTAX`
- :code:`AVAILABILITY`
- :code:`REPUTATION`

:code:`idna_subject`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The IDNA formatted subject. It is the subject that is internally exposed the all
supported testing methods.

You should consider this as the subject and consider the :code:`subject` key as
a placeholder of what was given by you.

:code:`params`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The parameters. It describes the parameter applied to the checker. In most case,
if you are using the Python API, you should be able to control most of them
through the **class constructor** or their **property setters** with the same
name.

sets of SPECIAL rules in order to escalate or deescalate the status of the given
subject.

This parameter lets the checker know that it is allowed to gather and use the
HTTP status code of the given subject to determine its status.
