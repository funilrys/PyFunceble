# .PyFunceble.yaml
# This is the default configuration of the PyFunceble project.
#
# Behavior while using CLI switch:
#
#   When using the CLI Argument of boolean parameters, they act like a light
#   switch. Meaning that if `no` is defined in the configuration file, using
#   the CLI argument will switch it to `yes`.
#
#   However, if `yes` is defined in the configuration file, using the CLI
#   argument will switch it to `no`.
#

debug:
  # Provides everything related to the debug mode.

  # Enable/Disable the debug mode.
  #
  # NOTE:
  #   When enabled, the output will be found inside the logs output directory.
  #   If you prefer to have the output to STDOUT, you should declare the
  #   following environment variable.

cli_decoding:
  # Provides everything related to the decoding of input files from the CLI.

  # Enable/Disable the aggressive decoding.
  #
  # The aggressive mode is a mode that tries to decode as much as possible without
  # trying to follow any technical conventions.
  #
  # When decoding AdBlock filter lists, it will try to decode almost every
  # domains it finds.
  #
  # When decoding hosts file or plain text files, it will try to convert URLS
  # (e.g https://example.org/hello/world) into domains to test (e.g example.org).
  #
  # CLI Argument: --aggressive
  aggressive: no

  # Enable/Disable the (exclusive) decoding using the adblock decoder.
  #
  # WARNING:
  #     Activating this parameter in your configuration file, will make

  #
  # WARNING:
  #     Activating this parameter will reduce wildcards (e.g *.example.org) to

  #
  # This mechanism let you cleanup your source file while being sure that
  # pyfunceble will retest the old entries of your source file. After retesting,

  # it into your ACTIVE output files so that you can reintroduce them into
  # your list.
  #
  # CLI Argument:  --inactive-db
  inactive_db: yes

  # Enable/Disable the whois storage of whois records.
  #
  # This mechanism let us avoid spaming the WHOIS servers by storing the

  #
  # CLI Argument: -wdb | --whois-database

  #
  # When enabled, we take the time to pre-load subjects by decoding inputs files
  # and storing the informatino in the chosen datasets/database format.
  # The hope is to optimise some of our process by only focusing on testing.
  #
  # WARNING:

  # Set the preferred pull "method".
  #
  # The platform (API) does not only provides datasets but it also offer an
  # aggregation endpoint that let PyFunceble pull datasets.
  # When pulling information about a subject that is already known by the platform,
  # it returns 3 group of results:
  #
  #   - `frequent`, which provides the status that was mostly been pushed.
  #   - `latest`, which provides the status based on the latest submitted datasets.
  #   - `recommended`, which provides the recommended status.
  #
  # CLI Argument: --platform-preferred-origin
  preferred_status_origin: recommended

  # Defines the checker type to prioritize when trying to fullfil platform
  # contracts.
  #
  # Notes:
  #   1. This is a list. The order matters.
  #   2. One can overwrite this value, by settings a comma separated list of
  #      checker type to prioritize through the PYFUNCEBLE_PLATFORM_CHECKER_PRIORITY
  #      environment variable.
  #   3. When set to `none`, the platform will throw a random contract at us.
  #
  # Example:
  #   Prioritize availability checker until no contract is available, then
  #   prioritize syntax checker until no contract is available, then prioritize
  #   reputation checker until no contract is available.
  #
  #   - availability
  #   - syntax
  #   - reputation
  #
  # Available Values: none | availability | reputation | syntax
  #
  # CLI Argument: none
  checker_priority:
    - none

  # Defines the checker type to exclude when trying to fullfil platform
  # contracts.
  #
  # Notes:
  #   1. This is a list.
  #   2. One can overwrite this value, by settings a comma separated list of
  #      checker type to exclude through the PYFUNCEBLE_PLATFORM_CHECKER_EXCLUDE
  #      environment variable.
  #   3. When set to `none`, no checker type will be excluded.
  #
  # Example:
  #   Exclude the reputation checker from the list of checker to use to fullfil.
  #
  #   - reputation
  #
  # Available Values: none | availability | reputation | syntax
  #
  # CLI Argument: none
  checker_exclude:
