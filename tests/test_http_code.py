This submodule will test PyFunceble.http_code


PyFunceble is the little sister of Funceble (https://github.com/funilrys/funceble)
which was archived on 13th March, 2018.

Its main objective is to get and the return domains and IPs availability by
generating an accurate result based on results from WHOIS, NSLOOKUP and HTTP status codes.

In its daily usage, PyFunceble is mostly used to clean `hosts` files or blocklist.
Indeed, it is possible because PyFunceble generates a list of all `ACTIVE` domains
or IPs but in the same time, it creates by default a database of the `INACTIVE`
domains or IPs so we can retest them overtime automatically at the next execution.

PyFunceble is running actively and daily with the help of Travis CI under 60+
repositories. It is used to clean or test the availability of data which are
present in hosts files, list of IP, list of domains, blocklists or even AdBlock
filter lists.
