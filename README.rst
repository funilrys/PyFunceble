PyFunceble is the little sister of `Funceble`_ which was archived on 13th March 2018.

Its main objective is to provide the availability of domains, IPs and since recently URL by generating an accurate result based on results from WHOIS, NSLOOKUP and HTTP status codes.

PyFunceble is currently running actively and daily with the help of Travis CI under 60+ repositories. It is used to clean or test the availability of data which are present in hosts files, list of IP, list of domains, block lists or even AdBlock filter lists.

PyFunceble provides some useful features for continuous testing.

As an example, its auto-continue system coupled with its auto-save system allows it to run nice and smoothly under Travis CI without even reaching Travis CI time restriction. In the other side, its internal inactive database system let :code:`INACTIVE` and :code:`INVALID` caught domains, IPs or URLs being automatically retested over time on next run.

What can PyFunceble do?
-----------------------

- Test of the availability of a domain.
- Test of the availability of an IPv4.
- Test of the availability of an URL.
- Test of the availability of a domain/DNS name in a private or local network.
- Test of the availability of an IPv4 in a private or local network.
- Test of the availability of an URL in a private or local network.
- Test of the syntax of a domain.
- Test of the syntax of an IPv4.
- Test of the syntax of an URL.
- Test of domain or IP which are present into an Adblock formatted file.
- Test from a given raw link.
- Save test result(s) on file(s) (hosts file, plain text and/or JSON format).
- Show test result(s) on screen.
- Show percentage of each status (:code:`ACTIVE`, :code:`INACTIVE`, :code:`INVALID`)
- Sort outputs hierarchically.
- "Mining" of domain or IP which are related to the tested element.
- Auto-continuation of tests in case of system crash or script stop.
- Filtering of a file content.

  - This feature will let us for example test all blogspot domain of the given file no matter the content of the file.

- Set the user-agent to use for the tests.
- Give some analytic depending of the HTTP status code (:code:`ACTIVE`, :code:`POTENTIALLY_ACTIVE`, :code:`POTENTIALLY_INACTIVE`, :code:`SUSPICIOUS`).
- Retest overtime of :code:`INACTIVE` and :code:`INVALID` domains.
- Print the execution time on screen and file.
- Customization of the different option via command-line arguments or configuration file.
- Continuous tests under Travis CI with the help of an auto saving and database system.

  - Set branch to push the result to for the autosaving system.
  - Set the minimal time before we autosave in order to avoid Travis CI limitation.
  - Set a command to execute at the end of the test.
  - Set the commit message for the autosaving system.

- ... and a lot more!
